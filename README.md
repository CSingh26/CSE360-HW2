# CSE360-HW2
# Assignment Overview

This assignment has been updated to clarify which User Stories to implement, that input validation is required, where to find sample UML documentation you are expected to produce, and other clarifications.

**Tasks 4 and 5 have been updated** to clarify what user stories you are to implement.

## Introduction

Using the provided foundational code and materials—as well as HW1 and/or TP1—each student must design, document, create, and then test a standalone application demonstrating a set of **Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD)** and input validation operations for each of the following items with sample data appropriate for the Team Project:

- **A question class**
- **An answer class**
- **A questions class** that supports storing all current questions as well as any subset of the questions (e.g., a subset reflecting the results of a search)
- **An answers class** that supports storing all potential answers to all stored questions and any subset of potential answers to a question (e.g., a subset reflecting the results of a search)

> **Note:** The above-mentioned subsets might be empty, might contain one or more elements, and may be arbitrarily large. There is no fixed upper limit to the number of elements in a list.

## Additional Guidelines

- **Ed Discussion Insights:**  
  You are urged to look at Ed Discussion to see the kind of question messages students sent and the kind of replies generated. Consider what information from the Ed Discussion system should be part of the Team Project program. Your testing should demonstrate realistic data (e.g., using actual Ed Discussion questions and answers).

- **Collaboration and Originality:**  
  Engage with your classmates—directly or via Ed Discussion—to identify potential attributes for the question and answer classes. Use the insights you gain to produce what you believe is required. **Do not blindly implement what you believe others are doing, and most definitely, do not copy their work!**

- **Documentation:**  
  Document your code and automated testing in a manner consistent with the provided materials. Remember, while the code tells the computer (and humans reading the code) what to do, it doesn't explain why a particular solution was chosen or why a simpler approach was not used.

- **Screencast Submission:**  
  Once all requirements are satisfied, create a short screencast demonstrating that the application performs each requirement and passes the tests. Use the provided MS Word template, fill it out, and submit it as a PDF where links can be copied and/or clicked to access the screencast and your personal GitHub.

- **Peer Support:**  
  You are encouraged to get help from your classmates if you have issues and offer help to others if you have your application running.
